[![Responsive Full Background Image](http://cdn.sixrevisions.com/0431-02_responsive_background_demo_ss.jpg)](http://sixrevisions.com/css/responsive-background-image/)

## What Is This?
These are the sources files for a Six Revisions tutorial called [Responsive Full Background Image Using CSS](http://sixrevisions.com/css/responsive-background-image/).

* `responsive-full-background-image.css` - this contains the CSS for achieving the responsive full background image
* `responsive-full-background-image-demo.html` - this is the HTML source code
* Files in the `/presentational-only` are not required. They're purely for demonstrative purposes.
* `/images` directory contains the background images. The background image is from [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com/).


```
background: url(background-photo.jpg) center center cover no-repeat fixed;
```

For a faster page load on small screens (i.e., mobile devices) a scaled-down version of the background image is served using a media query.
